# Collaboration Notes
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, etc.) and are often in PT-BR; keep style consistent.
- Project docs emphasize task tracking in docs/development/TASKS with IDs like BKD-001, FE-002.
- CLAUDE.md requests responses in PT-BR for that assistant; consider PT-BR communication preference.
